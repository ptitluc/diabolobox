Usage
-----
For each side of the box, generate a blank face with the `db_face` module.
If you have holes or marking to apply, do it on this volume to deal with 
easy coordinates. 
You can also apply options like feets or vents.

Then apply the diabolo system to the face with by calling the appropriate
`diabolize_` module for that face (see example).
